This code allows you to invite a list of users to multiple Slack channels using the Slack API. Here's a breakdown of how it works:


The code first imports the required modules: csv, time, WebClient and SlackApiError from the slack_sdk library.

The Slack API client is initialized with your bot token by passing it as an argument to the WebClient function.

The code reads a CSV file called channels.csv using the csv.DictReader function, which reads the file as a dictionary.

The user is prompted to enter a comma-separated list of user IDs.

The code loops through each row of the CSV file using a for loop. For each row, it extracts the value of the Channel ID key and assigns it to a variable called channel.

The code then loops through each user ID in the list provided by the user. For each user ID, it tries to add the user to the specified channel using the admin_conversations_invite method of the Slack API client. If the user is successfully added, it prints a message to the console saying that the user was added to the channel. If there is an error adding the user, it prints an error message to the console.

After attempting to add each user to the channel, the code adds a delay of 3 seconds using the time.sleep function to comply with the Slack API rate limits.

Once all users have been invited to the channel, the code adds another delay of 3 seconds before moving on to the next channel in the CSV file.

That's a high-level overview of how the code works. Let me know if you have any further questions!
